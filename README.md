## Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers for Relational and Temporal Data                                                                                                  
This project explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers (GTs) to model and analyze relational and temporal data. The primary objective is to build graph-based models capable of learning meaningful node and edge embeddings, integrating time-series data, and applying attention mechanisms for effective feature extraction.

Features
## 1. Study GNNs and Graph Transformers
## GNN Models:
Utilizes the PyTorch Geometric (PyG) library to handle graph-structured data. The aim is to design models that learn node and edge embeddings from the graph structure and features.

## Graph Transformers:
Implements attention mechanisms, including self-attention, to focus on important relationships within the graph. Temporal data handling is integrated into the model using Transformer layers, allowing it to capture sequential patterns and dependencies.

## 2. Graph Transformation
## Relational Data to Graph:

Converts data from CSV or SQL files containing student, course, and enrollment information into a graph structure.
Nodes: Represent students and courses.
Edges: Represent enrollment relationships (e.g., which student is enrolled in which course).
Node identifiers (student_id and course_id) are converted to categorical codes to create a proper edge index.
Node Features:
Each node is represented by a unique vector initialized as an identity matrix.

## 3. Time-Series Integration
Embedding Time-Series Data:
Integrates time-series data (e.g., student clicks or engagement trends) into the graph structure.
Preprocessed time_series_data is normalized or embedded and appended to existing student node features.
Student features are padded, and temporal features are merged with graph node features for enhanced analysis.
## 4. Graph Transformer Model Design
Model Design:

Attention mechanisms are implemented to capture the importance of different nodes and edges within the graph.
Temporal data is handled using models like Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) or other architectures capable of processing sequential information.

## Graph Transformer Layers:

Attends to spatial (relational) and temporal features of the graph using Transformer layers.
Learns dependencies and patterns effectively for advanced graph representation.
